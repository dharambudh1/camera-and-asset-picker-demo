# Camera & Asset Picker Demo

## About this app:

This is an example application showcasing how to select images from both the camera and the gallery. Users have the option to select either a single image or multiple images. 

When a user opts for taking a photo using the camera, they can capture one picture at a time. If a user selects an image from the gallery, they can choose multiple images simultaneously. 

Any picture, whether taken or chosen, will first go through an image cropping process before being displayed in the main home screen's grid view.
